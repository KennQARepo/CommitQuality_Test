//Text File used to Test,Practice, and Learn Git & GitHub.

//Created this text file using the 'touch' command in the Git Bash command Line.
//Text was created on the HP Laptop (meant ONLY for learning outside main/local networks).
//Purpose of this text/test: To Learn and work with git and github from external workstation.


//Learned the command: 'git push' - which is what push(es or send) the changes/ files to the repository (github).


	git push -u origin main

//-u  - is the command to indicate this file is to be tracked.
//origin -  is the labeling of the file and in this case it is the origin(al) file being tracked.
//main - is the labeling of the branch the git command ('push' in this case/scenario) is being executed.

//Editing text file from the GitHub repository 

DISREGARD FOLLOWING NOTE IN multiple comment lines:
/*(in actuality - was not able to edit textfile in github-repo, was redirected to github.dev; which is VSCode within the browser used while logged into GitHub)
*/

//Reason for this edit is to practice/learn/test the git command:
	git pull
this is to bring changes to your local machine, to HP Laptop.
/*
in this case - pulling edits and changes from GitHub.dev/ VSCode (in browser)
*/
